## Build Process

### Dependencies

- Android Studio

### Build

1. Clone or download this repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sam42a/jellyfin-androidtv-Enhanced.git
   cd jellyfin-androidtv-Enhanced
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio and run it from there or build an APK directly through Gradle:

   **Standard Version:**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew assembleStandardDebug  # Debug build
   ./gradlew assembleStandardRelease  # Release build
   ```
   
   **Enhanced Version (installable alongside original Jellyfin):**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew buildEnhanced  # Custom task to build enhanced release version
   ```
   
   Add the Android SDK to your PATH environment variable or create the ANDROID_SDK_ROOT variable for
   this to work.

### Deploy to device/emulator

   ```sh
   # Install standard version
   ./gradlew installStandardDebug
   
   # Install enhanced version (can coexist with original Jellyfin)
   ./gradlew installEnhancedRelease
   ```

**Note:** The enhanced version uses package ID `org.jellyfyn.androidtv.enhanced` which allows it to be installed alongside the original Jellyfin app.

### Build System Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- Android SDK with API level 35
